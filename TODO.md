List of things to do

- Factor standardization use scikit learn (Done)

- Change Y values to shifted X values for sequence learning (DONE)

- Does MSE need to be divided by batch size batch? No. Done in TF. (DONE)

- Implement Clairvioant and Naive models (DONE)

- Trainable ReLu units in MLP

- Batch normalization in RNN

- Regularization in cost function for RNN and MLP

- rename config's num_inputs to num_features

- rename config's nn_type to model_type
