Constructing model ...
Model has the following geometry:
  model_type  = ClvyntModel
  num_unroll  = 5
  batch_size  = 256
  num_inputs  = 16
  num_hidden  = 10
  num_layers  = 1
  optimizer   = AdagradOptimizer
  device      = /gpu:0
Created model with fresh parameters.
Training will early stop without improvement after 50 epochs.
